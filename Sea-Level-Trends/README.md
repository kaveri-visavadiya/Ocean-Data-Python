In this project, I focus on the Indian Ocean over the past 30 years (1993-2022) using ISRO's SLA (sea level anomaly) dataset and Copernicus temperature and salinity records to explore how the Indian Ocean's sea level, sea surface temperature and salinity have co-varied both in space and time. I plotted SLA time series for 4 major port cities in the Indian Ocean and projected impact on these cities if the sea level rise continues at the given rate. I explained the drivers behind regional variations and global trends of these ocean attributes (sea surface temperature, salinity and sea level anomaly) over the Indian Ocean. 

Used Python libraries matplotlib, numpy and mlp_toolkits.basemap for computation.
