In this project, I focus on the Indian Ocean over the past 30 years (1993-2022) using ISRO's SLA (sea level anomaly) dataset and Copernicus temperature and salinity records to explore how the Indian Ocean's sea leve, sea surface temperature and salinty have co-varied both in space and time. I plotted SLA time series for 4 major port cities in the Indian Ocean and attempted to explain the drivers behind regional variations and global trends. Used Python for computation.
